Aquasoil,High_Performance,TRUE,Fast,High,Soil_Leech,SILENT CYCLE,RECOMMENDED,"Since you have nutrient-rich soil, CO2, and high density of fast plants, the plants will consume the ammonia spike immediately. Optimal path."
Aquasoil,High_Performance,TRUE,Fast,High,Soil_Leech,DARK START,WARNING,"Inefficient. You have the hardware for immediate growth. Waiting 4 weeks wastes the initial soil nutrient spike that stems crave."
Aquasoil,High_Performance,TRUE,Fast,High,Liquid,FISHLESS,CRITICAL RISK,"Redundant and Dangerous. Soil is already leaching ammonia. Dosing liquid ammonia on top will cause toxicity."
Aquasoil,High_Performance,TRUE,Fast,High,Soil_Leech,FISHLESS,WARNING,"Slower. Since you have fast plants, waiting for the leeching phase without relying on plant uptake is slower than a Silent Cycle."
Aquasoil,High_Performance,TRUE,Fast,High,Soil_Leech,FISH-IN,CRITICAL RISK,"High Risk. Even with fast plants, Aquasoil ammonia spikes are unpredictable. Livestock may suffer burns."
Aquasoil,High_Performance,TRUE,Slow,Low,Soil_Leech,DARK START,RECOMMENDED,"Since you have high nutrients/light but slow/sparse plants, algae will dominate if you light the tank now. 4 weeks darkness prevents this."
Aquasoil,High_Performance,TRUE,Slow,Low,Soil_Leech,SILENT CYCLE,FAIL STATE,"Biomass Insufficient. Slow/sparse plants cannot metabolize the massive soil ammonia spike fast enough. Algae bloom guaranteed."
Aquasoil,High_Performance,TRUE,Slow,Low,Soil_Leech,FISHLESS,CONDITIONAL,"Valid ONLY if lights are dimmed. You must rely on water changes (not plants) to remove the leeching soil ammonia. High maintenance."
Aquasoil,High_Performance,FALSE,Any,Any,Soil_Leech,SILENT CYCLE,FAIL STATE,"Missing Engine. Without CO2, plants cannot metabolize nutrients fast enough to keep up with Aquasoil leaching. Algae takeover."
Aquasoil,High_Performance,FALSE,Any,Any,Soil_Leech,DARK START,RECOMMENDED,"Since you have high light potential but no CO2, a Dark Start allows the soil to off-gas ammonia safely before you risk turning on lights."
Aquasoil,High_Performance,FALSE,Any,Any,Soil_Leech,FISHLESS,CONDITIONAL,"Valid ONLY if lights are dimmed. High light without CO2 triggers algae immediately in nutrient-rich water."
Aquasoil,Basic,FALSE,Fast,High,Soil_Leech,SILENT CYCLE,WARNING,"Energy Bottleneck. Basic lights often lack the PAR to drive the rapid photosynthesis required for a true Silent Cycle. Melt risk."
Aquasoil,Basic,FALSE,Slow,Low,Soil_Leech,FISHLESS,RECOMMENDED,"Optimal Low Tech. Soil leeches ammonia, low light prevents algae, water changes keep it safe. Slow and steady."
Aquasoil,Basic,FALSE,Slow,Low,Soil_Leech,DARK START,RECOMMENDED,"Safe bet. Allows soil to settle without any algae risk. Works perfectly for low tech."
Inert,High_Performance,TRUE,Slow,Low,Liquid,FISHLESS,RECOMMENDED,"Optimal. You control the ammonia fuel precisely via dosing. Start lights dimmed to protect slow growing plants."
Inert,High_Performance,TRUE,Slow,Low,Liquid,DARK START,VALID,"Biologically Sound. Dosing liquid ammonia in the dark builds a strong bacterial colony with zero algae risk. Safe, but requires patience."
Inert,High_Performance,TRUE,Slow,Low,Liquid,SILENT CYCLE,FAIL STATE,"Impossible. Inert sand has no fuel (ammonia) to start the cycle. Slow plants cannot drive the cycle alone."
Inert,High_Performance,TRUE,Fast,High,Liquid,FISHLESS,WARNING,"Starvation Risk. Fast plants on inert sand need Liquid Macros (NPK) immediately, not just ammonia dosing. High maintenance start."
Inert,High_Performance,TRUE,Fast,High,Liquid,SILENT CYCLE,FAIL STATE,"Impossible. No soil ammonia to fuel the plants. They will melt within days."
Inert,High_Performance,FALSE,Any,Any,Liquid,FISHLESS,CONDITIONAL,"Valid ONLY if lights are dimmed. Dosing ammonia into a high-light/No-CO2 tank guarantees Green Water algae."
Inert,High_Performance,FALSE,Any,Any,Liquid,DARK START,RECOMMENDED,"Great strategy. Since you lack CO2 to fight algae, cycling in the dark allows you to establish bacteria safely before dealing with the light balance."
Inert,Basic,FALSE,Slow,Low,Liquid,FISHLESS,RECOMMENDED,"Optimal Low Tech. Dosing liquid ammonia is the standard, reliable method for inert substrates."
Inert,Basic,FALSE,Slow,Low,Liquid,FISH-IN,WARNING,"Cruelty Risk. Fishless dosing is equally effective and safer for livestock."
Inert,Basic,FALSE,Fast,High,Liquid,ANY METHOD,FAIL STATE,"Energy Bottleneck. Basic lights + No CO2 + Sterile Sand cannot support high density fast plants. They will rot."
Inert,Any,Any,Any,Any,None,FISHLESS,FAIL STATE,"Missing Fuel. No Soil Leech, No Liquid Ammonia. You cannot cycle a tank with water and rocks."
Inert,Any,Any,Any,Any,None,FISH-IN,CRITICAL RISK,"Last Resort. Since substrate is sterile and you lack liquid ammonia, you are relying entirely on fish waste. High stress for animals."
Inert,Any,Any,Any,Any,None,SILENT CYCLE,FAIL STATE,"Missing Fuel. You cannot do a Silent Cycle without Aquasoil."
