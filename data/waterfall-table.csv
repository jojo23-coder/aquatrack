1,PHYSICS_ERROR,Inert,ANY,ANY,ANY,ANY,ANY,Soil_Leech,ANY,FAIL STATE,"Impossible Physics. Inert substrate cannot leech ammonia. You must select Liquid Ammonia."
2,CRUELTY_RISK,ANY,ANY,ANY,ANY,ANY,ANY,None,FISH-IN,CRITICAL RISK,"Animal Cruelty. With no soil or liquid ammonia, you are forcing fish to generate the cycle waste in a sterile tank."
3,MISSING_FUEL,ANY,ANY,ANY,ANY,ANY,ANY,None,FISHLESS,FAIL STATE,"Missing Fuel. You cannot run a fishless cycle without an ammonia source (Liquid or Soil)."
4,DOUBLE_DOSE,Aquasoil,ANY,ANY,ANY,ANY,ANY,Liquid,FISHLESS,CRITICAL RISK,"Toxicity Spike. Aquasoil already releases ammonia. Dosing liquid ammonia on top will create toxic levels."
5,LIGHT_INSUFFICIENT,ANY,Basic,ANY,ANY,High,ANY,ANY,ANY,FAIL STATE,"Hardware Failure. You selected High Light Demand plants but only have Basic Lights. They will die regardless of the cycle."
6,SILENT_REQ_SOIL,Inert,ANY,ANY,ANY,ANY,ANY,ANY,SILENT CYCLE,FAIL STATE,"Method Failure. Silent Cycle relies on soil nutrients to feed roots. Inert sand cannot support this."
7,SILENT_REQ_BIOMASS,ANY,ANY,ANY,ANY,ANY,Low,ANY,SILENT CYCLE,FAIL STATE,"Biology Failure. Silent Cycle requires High Plant Density to consume ammonia immediately. Low density results in algae."
8,SILENT_REQ_SPEED,ANY,ANY,ANY,Slow,ANY,ANY,ANY,SILENT CYCLE,FAIL STATE,"Biology Failure. Slow plants (Buce/Anubias) cannot metabolize ammonia fast enough for a Silent Cycle. You need Fast Stems."
9,SILENT_REQ_CO2,ANY,ANY,FALSE,ANY,High,ANY,ANY,SILENT CYCLE,FAIL STATE,"Metabolic Failure. High Demand plants without CO2 cannot grow fast enough to absorb the ammonia spike."
10,SILENT_REQ_LIGHT,ANY,Basic,ANY,Fast,Low,ANY,ANY,SILENT CYCLE,WARNING,"Energy Bottleneck. Even for low-demand weeds, basic lights might be too weak to drive the *rapid* growth needed for a Silent Cycle."
11,ALGAE_BOMB_CHECK,ANY,High_Performance,FALSE,ANY,Low,ANY,Liquid,FISHLESS,CONDITIONAL,"Algae Risk. High Light + Low Demand Plants + No CO2 = Algae Farm. You must DIM lights to <30%."
12,DARK_START_INEFFICIENT,Aquasoil,ANY,ANY,Fast,ANY,ANY,Soil_Leech,DARK START,WARNING,"Wasted Potential. Fast plants need nutrients immediately. A Dark Start removes the initial soil ammonia spike they crave."
13,DARK_START_POINTLESS,Inert,ANY,ANY,ANY,ANY,ANY,None,DARK START,FAIL STATE,"Pointless. Inert substrate with no ammonia source is just a bucket of water. Darkness achieves nothing."
14,FAST_PLANT_STARVATION,Inert,ANY,ANY,Fast,High,ANY,ANY,ANY,FAIL STATE,"Starvation. High Demand Fast plants need Soil or Water Column dosing + High Light. On Inert sand, they will die."
15,FAST_PLANT_HUNGER,Inert,ANY,ANY,Fast,Low,ANY,Liquid,FISHLESS,WARNING,"Nutrient Gap. Low Demand Fast plants (weeds) survive light levels, but starve on Inert sand. You MUST add Liquid Fertilizer daily."
16,OPTIMAL_SILENT,Aquasoil,High_Performance,TRUE,Fast,High,High,Soil_Leech,SILENT CYCLE,RECOMMENDED,"Optimal Match. High energy, high demand, and high biomass will consume the soil ammonia instantly."
17,OPTIMAL_DARK_START,Aquasoil,High_Performance,TRUE,Slow,Low,ANY,Soil_Leech,DARK START,RECOMMENDED,"Optimal Match. High light + Slow plants usually equals algae. Dark start avoids this risk perfectly."
18,OPTIMAL_LOW_TECH_SOIL,Aquasoil,Basic,FALSE,Slow,Low,ANY,Soil_Leech,FISHLESS,RECOMMENDED,"Optimal Low Tech. Soil provides nutrients, low light prevents algae, and water changes manage the cycle."
19,OPTIMAL_INERT_DOSING,Inert,ANY,ANY,Slow,Low,ANY,Liquid,FISHLESS,RECOMMENDED,"Optimal Control. Dosing liquid ammonia allows precise control for delicate/slow plants. Safe and reliable."
20,VALID_DARK_START_INERT,Inert,ANY,ANY,ANY,ANY,ANY,Liquid,DARK START,VALID,"Biologically Valid. Dosing ammonia in the dark cycles the bacteria safely without any algae risk."
21,DEFAULT_SILENT,ANY,ANY,ANY,ANY,ANY,ANY,ANY,SILENT CYCLE,FAIL STATE,"Configuration Mismatch. You selected Silent Cycle but lack the specific Hardware/Plant combination to make it safe."
22,DEFAULT_DARK_START,ANY,ANY,ANY,ANY,ANY,ANY,ANY,DARK START,RECOMMENDED,"Safe Fallback. Dark Start is rarely 'wrong', just sometimes slow."
23,DEFAULT_FISHLESS,ANY,ANY,ANY,ANY,ANY,ANY,ANY,FISHLESS,RECOMMENDED,"Standard Method. If no other warnings triggered, Fishless Cycling is the standard recommendation."
24,DEFAULT_FISH_IN,ANY,ANY,ANY,ANY,ANY,ANY,ANY,FISH-IN,WARNING,"Suboptimal. Fishless methods are objectively safer. Proceed only if you are experienced."
